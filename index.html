    <p>I’ve documented every single DailyPayout percentage within 4 Months to calulate the Differece between keeping the DailyPayouts versus Reinvesting in the same 4 Months. You can either receive what you Invested in 4 Months without Reinvesting or.... well just watch for yourself don't want to do a Spoiler!<p>

<p>If you would like to see that it will only take you 8 Months to turn a <code>$100 Lend into $1,000</code> or for a <code>$1,000 Lend into $10,000</code>. I will demonstrate how with using our BitConnect Calclator that will show you. You will be shown how it will take for a $100.00 investment and turn it into $1,000.00 or more. Or even taking a $1,000.00 and turn that into $10,000.00 investment that generates a $3,000.00+ monthly payout every month in as little as 7 to 8 Months from when you started.<p>

  How I and many of the Members in the MyCoins2 Team started but not limited to;<p>
  1. Have an email account<p>

  2. Make an account at Coinbase<p>
<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/59922ae33a190500d7ae0fed">coinbase.com</a> by using this link curtesy of NsBm0d everybody who buys or sells $100 of digital currency or more you'll earn $10 of free bitcoin!
       Use your email:
       Something@mail.com
    A password:
      Password1isname!
           You will need to link a bank account or a credit card to your Coinbase account in order to purchase Crypto currency (Bitcoin "BTC" is the one you'll want buy for this process)<p>

  3. Make an account at BitConnect<p>
  <a href="https://bitconnect.co/?ref=MyCoins2">BitConnect.io</a>
      Can use your same email:
      Something@mail.com
   A password:
      Password2isname!<p>
        When you are ready to bring your Daily Payouts out to spend you'll need to transfer the USD from your Lending wallet back into BitConnect coin wallet. Then you will use it to buy Bitcoin again. Then transfer your Bitcoin from your BitConnect BTC wallet to your Coinbase BTC wallet then sell them for USD. Or just transfer your BTC to a BitPay BTC wallet. Then you can spend your $ back in the states through your BitPay Visa debit card.<p>

        Make an account at BitPay<p>
  <a href="https://www.BitPay.com">BitPay.com</a>
        Use your same email:
            Something@mail.com
        A password:
            Password3isname!<p>

Whenever you are ready to Invest into Crypto Cerrency;<p>
I would recommend at least $150.00 from credit card or linked bank account, this should cover all fees so that you will have over $100 to invest with. Then use it on Coinbase to buy Bitcoin "BTC"<p>

Now transfer that Bitcoin from your Coinbase BTC wallet over to your BitConnect BTC wallet <p>
Now use your Bitcoin "BTC" to buy BitConnect coin "BCC" then loan out a minimum of $100.00 worth of your BitConnect coin & start making $ back in your BitConnect's lending wallet. You can then reinvest in multiples of $10 as new a loan, or transfer it back into BitConnect coin and use it to buy Bitcoin to spend back in the states through BitPay Visa debit card or go through Coinbase then the bank that you have linked to your account.<p>

  Start Building your Crypto Portfolio while you can still be ahead of the movement.</p>
